00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,000
[RAFIKI]
It's time to tell you a story.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,500
A story of a cub not much bigger than you.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
[TIMON]
So, just to be clear,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
[TIMON]
we are not in this story?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
[PUMBA]
There's a lot of stories with all of us!

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,800
[PUMBA]
Tell one of those!

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,000
[RAFIKI]
Long before, they became legends...

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,500
[RAFIKI]
Mufasa and the prince who would come to be known as Scar,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,200
[RAFIKI]
became brothers.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,500
[TAKA]
Hello, what's your name?

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,000
[MUFASA]
Mufasa

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,200
[ESHE]
I told you to wait for me!

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,900
[TAKA]
We can't just leave him here!

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,700
[ESHE]
Rules are rules, Taka!

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,800
[ESHE]
The king will never accept a stray!

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
[MUFASA]
I am not a stray..

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,800
[MUFASA]
I am just.. lost

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,000
[MUSIC] ðŸŽµðŸŽµ

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,800
[OBASI]
We do not associate with outsiders

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,500
Taka is the future king.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,000
We must protect the bloodline.

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,000
[TAKA]
But dad, I saved his life!

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
